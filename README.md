PHPInsight - Sentiment classifier for PHP
---------

PHPInsight is a sentiment classifier. It uses a list of words that are categorised as positive, negative or neutral to determine sentiment.

For example usage, see the `examples` folder.

**Note:** This repo is a continuation of the [original package by JWHennessey](https://github.com/JWHennessey/phpInsight). I will be maintaining the codebase by adding support for newer PHP versions, but will not be actively working on bug fixes or general improvements. Feel free to contribute and submit PRs.
